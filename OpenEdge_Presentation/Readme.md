Currently using mySQL database for Python and Java.

The sample database classicmodels can be found here: http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx. We're using this one because it closely mirrors a Customer table in the OE sports2000 database. Only work that needs to be done is to add a Balance column and update it to have some kind of value.

Will use Microsoft SQL Express Server if I get that working. Otherwise, will just use a mySQL connector with C#.
