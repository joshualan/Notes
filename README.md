# Notes

This is simply a repository for me to dump down the notes of whatever I'm learning at the moment. 

It's also a good way to make sure that I follow the "No Zero Day" rule, where I try to do something related to my passion everyday. Even if I don't code every day, this doesn't necessarily mean I'm being idle.
